# obsidian github setup

  ### Step 1: Set Up Your Repository

1. **Ensure Your Repository is Ready**:
    - Make sure your Obsidian vault is already pushed to a GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a Workflow File**:
    
    - In your repository, create a directory named `.github/workflows` if it doesn't already exist.
    - Inside this directory, create a new file named `deploy.yml`.
2. **Add the Following Workflow Configuration**:
    
    Copy
    
    `name: Deploy Obsidian Vault with Quartz on:   push:     branches:       - main  # Change this to your default branch if it's not 'main' jobs:   build-and-deploy:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: Checkout repository        uses: actions/checkout@v2       - name: Set up Node.js        uses: actions/setup-node@v2         with:           node-version: '16'  # You can specify the Node.js version you need       - name: Install Quartz        run: npm install -g @quartz/cli       - name: Build static site        run: quartz build       - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3         with:           github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}           publish_dir: ./_site`
    

### Step 3: Commit and Push the Workflow File

1. **Commit the Workflow File**:
    - Add, commit, and push the `deploy.yml` file to your repository:
        
        Copy
        
        `git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for deploying Obsidian vault" git push origin main  # Change 'main' to your default branch if different`
        

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Go to your repository on GitHub.
    - Click on “Settings.”
    - Scroll down to the “Pages” section.
    - Select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
    - Click “Save.” GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site will be hosted (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-obsidian-vault`).

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

1. **Trigger the Workflow**:
    
    - Push a change to your repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
    - Go to the “Actions” tab in your repository to monitor the workflow run.
2. **Access Your Published Vault**:
    
    - Once the workflow completes successfully, you can access your published Obsidian vault at the provided GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Tips

- **Customization**: You can customize the workflow file to fit your specific needs, such as adding additional steps for linting, testing, or notifications.
- **Secrets**: If you need to use secrets (e.g., API keys), you can add them to your repository settings under “Settings” > “Secrets and variables” > “Actions.”
- **Updates**: Any push to the specified branch (e.g., `main`) will trigger the workflow, ensuring your site is always up-to-date.

By following these steps, you can automate the process of building and deploying your Obsidian vault as a static website using GitHub Actions and Quartz.
